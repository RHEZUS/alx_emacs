* In emacs when you want to research a string in a file, you can use the *backword search*. It works by browsing the file from the bottom to find the the string you are searching instead of starting from the beginning. This helps you find the word faster and avoid spending time scrrolling. 

You can use it by:
   1. maintaining the *ctrl* button pressed,
   2. press the *r* button  
   3. leave the *ctrl* button
   4. write the string you want to search
   5. press enter
